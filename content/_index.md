Hi! I'm Anish Patil

I'm a Software Artisan and Indie Hacker living in Melbourne.
I have worked on Backend, Modern Front-end.DevOps to mentoring junior team membersÂ in my career span of 17 years.
I help startups to scale up and  manage their technical direction.

I'm intensely interested in software complexity, I believe complexity is one of the hindrances of reaching the market.I help companies to  manage software complexity by introducing pragmatic software engineering processes.

In the early days of my career, I  have contributed to numerous open source projects such as GNOME,Fedora.
I have started a  [Typing Booster project](https://mike-fabian.github.io/ibus-typing-booster/) to ease typing in native languages on the Linux desktop. Now this project is maintained by the community.
